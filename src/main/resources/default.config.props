# Beancounter configuration properties file
# Please read this file carefully and modify as appropriate, as it controls the startup parameters of your bot.
# Unless otherwise noted, all properties expect a single string value.

# REQUIRED SETTINGS
# You must specify these values, or the bot will explode on you at startup.

# serverHost: String - Hostname of the IRC server to connect to.
serverHost=

# OPTIONAL SETTINGS
# If these values are not specified, hardcoded defaults (shown below) will be used instead.
# Remember to uncomment the values if you wish to change them!

# botName: String - Nickname the bot should attempt to use. Defaults to Beancounter.
#botName=Beancounter

# useTls: Boolean - Set this to true if the bot should attempt to use an encrypted IRC connection (default)
#useTls=true

# verifyHostname: Boolean - Only effective if useTls is true. If verifyHostname is true (default), verify that the
# name of the server on the presented certificate matches the serverHost property above.  Bot will abort connection if
# the verification fails. IMPORTANT: This property does NOT control Java's own built-in certificate validation routines!
#verifyHostname=true

# allowedCertificates: String - Only effective if useTls is true. Set allowedCertificates to the hexadecimal MD5, SHA1,
# SHA256, or SHA512 fingerprint of the certificate(s) you want to allow - non-matching certs will cause the bot to
# abort connecting. Specify multiple fingerprints by separating then with commas. Leave blank to not perform this
# certificate pinning (default).
#allowedCertificates=

# serverPort: Integer - Set this to the port the bot should use to connect to the IRC server. The default value depends
# on the setting of useTls. If useTls is true, serverPort defaults to 6697; otherwise it defaults to 6667.
#serverPort=

# autoJoinChannels: String - Set this to a list of comma-separated channels the bot should always join on startup. By
# default, will not attempt to join any channels.
#autoJoinChannels=
