/**
 * LIZARDIRC BEANCOUNTER GAMES PLATFORM ENTERPRISE EDITION 1<p>
 *
 * This interface represents the standard methods any BGP-EE game must (abstract methods) or may (default methods)
 * implement.  Please refer to the Javadoc of each respective method for more information.<p>
 *
 * Note that a class implementing this interface does not mean it will be detected as a game by Beancounter - the game's
 * main class must implement this interface and be annotated with {@code @}{@link GameEntrypoint}, which provides
 * access to some metadata without having to instantiate the game's class.  See the documentation for
 * {@code @GameEntrypoint} for more information about the contract game classes must follow, including the constructor
 * game classes must provide.<p>
 *
 * A general warning: Ensure that in any of the four methods that provide commands,
 * (get|handle)(Active|Setup)PhaseCommands?, you don't provide a command whose name clashes with a command specified
 * elsewhere in the main section of the bot (primarily org.lizardirc.beancounter.commands.*).  Until the bot has proper
 * handling of contextual commands, this will cause an exception to be thrown whenever the command is given, and all
 * instances of the command will be unusable.
 *
 * @param <T> I still have no idea what this is actually for.  Thanks PircBotX!
